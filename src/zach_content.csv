Wesley and I have been friends for twenty years! 

In college, Wesley was dead set on being an accountant. He knew exactly what he was going to do, how much money he was going to make. Until one day, one of his professors told him that 90% of accountant jobs would be automated in the next 20 years. 

Wesley approached me about computer science and programming when I was a year into my data engineering career. We both saw JavaScript as being a red hot technology to learn and we really wanted to learn it. 

We started to learn it by building a Pokedex because we were really passionate about Pokemon. 

Later we built Art Lineup (https://www.artlineup.me) which was a product that helped artists manage inventory and expenses. We made a lot of progress on this product but we also made a lot of mistakes. 

After that, Wesley used Art Lineup and the Pokedex to find a job as a software engineer at WaveOrtho. He got this job without a degree, without going to a bootcamp, and without getting a certificate. 

Wesley then went on to growing into management at WaveOrtho and really focuses on his family life and living his best life nowadays with his wife and son. He has gathered a lot of wisdom about software and business from this.

This episode today is about how data analysts really have a lot of the core skills needed to do data engineering and what tools they should add to their tool belt to make that career transition!

Data analysts and data engineers generally have a shared skillset around: 

- SQL
- Data analysis
- Gathering requirements from stakeholders
- Solving business problems with data

Data analysts also often have strong storytelling and data visualization skills as well which can be strong assets in data engineering!

The key things that data analysts need to learn to really succeed at data engineering are:

- Git
   - without git, collaborating on pipeline code with your teammates it’s very challenging
- Python
   - a vast majority of data engineering jobs require knowing Python. 
- A way to transform the data at scale, such as tools like Apache Spark, Snowflake, and BigQuery 
- A scheduling library to automate your pipelines, such as Apache Airflow


If data analysts can learn these technical skills, they become unstoppable because they already know how to ask the right business questions. These skills empower them to go and get that data as well!

2022-02-10 17:32:44.000000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFRYfBmRJaI,"How is data engineering different between Airbnb, Facebook, and Netflix? How is data engineering different between Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb?

So, I started my big tech data engineering career at Facebook in 2016. I worked there for about 2 years. Then I jumped to Netflix where I worked for about 2 years. I’ve currently been at Airbnb for about a year. 

Working at these companies gave me a taste of a bunch of different flavors of data engineering. They have some similarities and some differences. Let’s dive into it! 

Let’s start with when I worked at Facebook. 
At Facebook, I worked in growth analytics data engineering. There was a strong focus in my role creating metrics that could be used to measure incremental impact of experiments. 

The languages I used: 
- Python
- SQL

The execution engines I used were:
- SparkSQL
- Apache Hive
- Presto/Trino

The storage systems I used were:
- Hadoop

The file formats I used were:
- ORC (optimized row columnar)

The scheduler I used was Dataswarm (https://asiliconvalleyinsider.com/2016/05/01/data-engineering-facebook/), which is Facebook’s internal scheduler very similar in API design to Apache Airflow. 

My role at Facebook had the strongest focus on visualization out of the three companies. I used a mix of Tableau and an internal tool called Unidash (https://medium.com/analytics-and-data/i-hear-facebook-has-data-does-it-have-data-tools-a9f4c4d82ee7)

Data quality checks were generally put in after a data quality error in the data instead of proactively since Facebook really focuses on “moving fast” 

Something unique about Facebook was Presto was often used in ETL code where as at the other companies Presto is strictly used for auditing only and Spark does the heavy lifting. Also every pipeline I wrote at Facebook was SQL-based which is very different from Netflix and Airbnb. 

Next up, Netflix

At Netflix, I worked in platform and security data engineering. I did a mix of creating metrics for experiments and creating master data for the InfoSec teams to use. 

The languages I used were:
- Python
- SQL
- Scala 

The execution engines I used were:
- SparkSQL and Scala Spark
- Presto/Trino (for data audits and analysis)

The storage systems I used were:
- S3
- Apache Druid (for visualization)
- Postgres (for low-latency queries)

The file formats I used were:
- Parquet

The scheduler I used was an internal scheduler called Meson (https://netflixtechblog.com/meson-workflow-orchestration-for-netflix-recommendations-fc932625c1d9)  which took in a YAML file to generate the pipeline DAG. I prefer Python APIs for schedulers over YAML-based APIs. 

Proactive data quality was pushed heavily at Netflix. They really like the write-audit-publish pattern and want you to have all your ETLs use it. 

I did very light visualization work at Netflix. They have analytics engineers and viz specialists there who focus more deeply on it. 

Netflix also focused on unit and integration testing of ETLs, which Airbnb also does but Facebook did not since Facebook is so SQL-focused. 

Something unique about Netflix is there was a good mix of PySpark and Scala Spark due to their “freedom and responsibility” culture which allowed for more variations in ETLs.  



Next up, Airbnb

At Airbnb, I work in commercial products data engineering. I work mostly on creating high quality master data and leadership since I’m at tech lead at Airbnb. 

The languages I use are:
- Python
- SQL
- Scala 

The execution engines I use are:
- SparkSQL and Scala Spark
- Presto (for data audits and analysis)

The storage systems I use are:
- S3
- Apache Superset (for visualization)
- Postgres (for low-latency queries)

The file formats I used were:
- Parquet

The scheduler I used was of course, Apache Airflow, the popular open source tool created by Airbnb. 

Proactive data quality is pushed heavily at Airbnb. There’s a company wide process called the MIDAS process which is a very thorough process for creating high quality data (https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data-quality-at-airbnb-870d03080469). We use an internal framework called Wall for our data quality checks (https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-built-wall-to-prevent-data-bugs-ad1b081d6e8f).",448,9966,YouTube,,2

You can check out my analytics app that leverages these SQL queries here: https://www.halogods.com

We’re going to cover: 

Why is data quality important?
- Data powers so many decisions nowadays
-- Low-quality data = low-quality decisions
--- Whether that is big expensive decisions by CEOs
--- Data scientists making incorrect decisions about AB tests
--- Or machine learning models making million of low-quality decisions every day 

What are the different types of data quality issues?

Incorrectness
Common errors in this class:
Duplicates
NULLs
Inconsistency in reporting

Incompleteness 
Common errors in this class:
Missing an important dimensions 
Not a robust enough data model to answer the questions you want

Design problems
Common errors in this class:
Answering your questions is prohibitively expensive


What causes data quality issues? 
Logging bugs
Duplicates entering production databases
Third-party APIs breaking contract


How do you automate checking for common data quality errors?
The most common way to do this is using the write-audit-publish pattern
Write to a staging table
Run your audit queries that check for things like NULLs and duplicates
If the audits pass, publish the staging table data to production


What are some tools to check out to accomplish these things?
If you’re using Apache Spark, check out Amazon Deequ
If you’re streaming data with Kafka and Flink, check out Apache Griffin
For everybody else, check out Great Expectations",232,3941,YouTube,,2

""""
""1. async/await ""

""""
""The main minus here is around older browser support. I highly recommend this way of async programming for NodeJS!""
""""
""2. Promises ""
""Promises work by returning a wrapper that has “resolve” and “reject” functions. If the async code succeeds, it resolves the data and returns it in the first function in the .then block. If it fails it either passes the data to 2nd function in the .then block OR the .catch block depending on the type of failure. ""
""""
""Promises are really nice since they have backwards compatibility with any browser and they’re the most flexible option for handling async code. ""

""3. Callbacks ""
""Callbacks work by passing a function to call once the async code finishes executing. Callback “hell” is very real and I mostly advise against this way of handling async code. ""

""- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (4/5 ⭐️) ""

""""
""- Somatic touch therapy (5/5 ⭐️)""
""This therapy did wonders for me. It works by having a therapist apply pressure to various parts of your body and have you discuss what memories come up. This helps release stored trauma in the body and helped me really get a grapple on my anxiety. ""
""""
""- Safe and sound protocol (SSP) (5/5 ⭐️)""
""SSP works be playing high pitched music to tune your vagus nerve and make you feel more social and less anxious. This therapy really helped me overcome a lot of my social anxiety and made it more possible for me to be as outspoken as I am now.  ""
""""
""- SSRI medications (2/5 ⭐️)""
""SSRIs work by increasing the density of serotonin in your brain. I tried these for 3 months and noticed a lessening of my anxiety but it came with side effects. For me the side effects were a flatlined mood that made me feel like a zombie. ""
""""
""- Adopting a Dog (6/5 ⭐️)""
""I adopted a dog a few months after the pandemic started. I was initially worried it wasn’t going to work out but after a few months I realized she’s perfect for me. She keeps me on a regular schedule and shows me unconditional love. She’s great at keeping the loneliness and anxiety at bay. ""
""""
""- Mindfulness and meditation (3/5 ⭐️)""
""Meditation and mindfulness exercises work by slowing your mind down and allowing you to just exist. I’ve found this useful in specific situations but not overall very useful.  For me, 2-3 minute mindfulness exercises before a big presentation/meeting/video really does help me be as fluid and eloquent as I can be. I hope to keep adopting this though and to see more benefits!""
""""
""- Seeking out a supportive community  (5/5 ⭐️) ""
""Community matters a lot I realized. Not just family and close friends but also who else is in your community. Building a big network both online and offline has been a great source of support for me over the past year! ""
""""
""- Being mindful of my screen time (4/5 ⭐️)""

""- How is data engineering different between Facebook and Airbnb? ""
""Facebook has a bit more mature and unique infrastructure and a majority of their pipelines are SQL-based.  ""
""Airbnb uses AWS cloud tooling and focuses on using Scala Spark to create their pipelines. ""
""""
""- What are the cons to impact-driven culture? ""
""I think the biggest con is that impact has to be measured on a certain time scale which can often artificially be short time scales like 1 year (i.e. the average performance review cycle). How much impact you can squeeze into a year may make you more likely to make short-term tradeoffs at the expensive of long-term sustainability. This balance is critical to get right when engineering sustainable, scalable systems over the long-term! ""

I never really used Scala at Facebook but learning it in my spare time was important for getting a job at Netflix! Try new things even if you’re skeptical of them. Build new habits and grow! We talked about the various roles in tech like full stack and data. Where should you go? I’ve noticed that more artsy people gravitate towards full stack since it’s more visual than data is generally speaking! We talked about interviews.

""- Learn from your teammates ""

""Some key things you need to talk about in interviews are the impact you made in your previous roles (or a cool portfolio piece if you're breaking into #dataengineering). You need to have SQL down extremely well and be able to think quickly on your feet. There's always a data modeling round and a data architecture round too. Remember to treat these rounds as discussions and not be too laser-focused on answering the question. You want to show that you're good to work with not just that you're a good problem solver!""

""Kimball is better at preserving data integrity and for 80+% of the data modeling use cases out there it is going to be the preferred way to model the data.

""""
""- Snowflake or Databricks?""
""I like Databricks a lot since it has the versatility of Apache Spark. That being said, it's a more technical platform that takes much longer to learn and set up. The amount of time it takes to get value out of Snowflake is very little and that's a very impressive quality of Snowflake.""

""- AWS or GCP or Azure?""
""AWS is the clear leader in market share and I have a slight bias towards using it over GCP or Azure. That being said, there will always be great Azure and GCP data engineering jobs as well! ""

""""
""Here’s why:""
""""
""- Kimball modeling didn’t think about distributed compute environments or large scale data ""
""""
""- Splitting everything up into tables that can’t be broadcast JOIN’d in Spark is expensive. ""
""""
""- Doing JOINs with extremely high volume fact data is joke ""

""I saw DRAMATIC increases in efficiencies when changing to this data model for pricing and availability at Airbnb. ""
""""
""Here are the tenets of “one big table”""
""""
""- You should model dimensions cumulatively""
""- You should include arrays of STRUCT that describes the facts, preferably in the order of occurrence ""
""- Your table should still be normalized and deduped by the dimension identifiers ""
""- Use array functions like REDUCE and TRANSFORM to analyze fact data without needing to shuffle ""
""- use UNNEST and CROSS JOIN to create filtered, low retention data sets that are easier to query!""

""""
""- SCD ""
""It means slowly changing dimension which is an attributed of an entity that changes with time. For example, my favorite food in the 2010s was lasagna now it’s curry. Dimensions that change are SCDs. Ones that don’t are fixed dimensions (I.e. my birthdate can’t change). ""
""""
""- DAG ""
""It means directed acyclical graph. This is a series of steps that execute in order. You might have an extract step then an aggregation step then an upload step. The chain of tasks and dependencies is a “graph.” It’s acyclical because the upload step can’t then depend on the extract step because then the pipeline would never execute. DAG and pipeline are often used interchangeably. ""
""""
""- WAP pattern ""
""It means write-audit-publish pattern. This is a common data quality pattern that prevents bad data from entering production by writing to a staging table first. Then performing data quality checks. Then if they pass, publish the staging data to production. ""
""""
""- OOM exception ""
""It means out of memory exception. This happens when a pipeline step doesn’t have adequate RAM to process a data set. Most common cause is skewed data but can also happen because of memory misconfiguration.  ""

""""
""Thinking about impact in terms of lines of code is a very rudimentary and flawed way of thinking. ""
""""
""There are many ways to have an impact beyond churning out code:""
""""
""- Changing stakeholders' intuitions about the business""
""If you produce data sets that mostly reaffirm everyone's intuitions about the business, you're more likely to be taken for granted. Supplying data that actually changes decision-making processes is a huge way to have an impact as a data engineer. ""
""A critical question you should be asking when writing a pipeline is, ""How will the business operate differently when they have visibility that this pipeline provides?"" If the answer is, not much, then it's probably the wrong pipeline to be working on and you should push back! ""
""""
""- Saving money in the cloud ""
""Cloud cost savings can happen in a few different buckets. Storage, compute and IO are the three big ones. Optimizing a pipeline is a great way to save money. An even better way to save money is by deprecating that pipeline. ""
""Often times in big organizations you'll have duplicate pipelines that each give roughly the same data set. Finding these inefficiencies and building more robust data models that minimize the number of pipelines that you need can be another great way to have an impact!""
""""
""- Reducing the on-call burden ""
""On-call is one of the most expensive parts of managing the data engineering process. Data engineer time is extremely expensive. If you can increase the reliability of your pipelines, you'll not only be liked more by your team but also save your company a lot of money! ""
""""
""- Improving development efficiencies""
""Is deploying and testing your pipeline incredibly slow? If you can find ways to deploy, build or test your pipelines faster and then get those methods adopted by your teams, that's a great way to have a ""horizontal"" impact and act as a force multiplier. Imagine saving 100 engineers 10 minutes a day, that's a HUGE impact that will result in you getting promoted pretty quickly! ""
